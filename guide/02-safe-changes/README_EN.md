# Safe Changes

[🇹🇷 Türkçe](README.md)

## Problem

When an agent is asked to make a small change, it may modify other areas that are not needed to produce the requested result.

For example, while fixing a single link, the agent may also rewrite text in the same file or change unrelated files. The requested link may be correct, but the change has gone beyond the assigned scope.

## Core rule

> **Before making a change, define what may change and what must be preserved. Make the smallest change needed to achieve the requested result.**

## Change boundary

For a simple task, three fields may be enough:

- **CHANGE:** What should be changed.
- **PRESERVE:** What must remain unchanged.
- **DO NOT:** Actions that are outside the task scope.

For example:

```text
CHANGE:
- Replace the old link in README.md with the new one.

PRESERVE:
- Other text
- Heading order
- File structure

DO NOT:
- Do not change other files.
- Do not rewrite unrelated text.
```

These boundaries do not need to become a long list for every task. For a small change, identifying only the critical constraints is usually enough.

## Make the smallest necessary change

An agent should not add unrelated improvements to the same change.

If one line is enough to correct a typo, rewriting the paragraph or reformatting the file is unnecessary. If the agent notices another issue, reporting it separately is safer than silently expanding the task.

## Example

An agent is asked to replace one link in a README file.

Expected change:

```text
README.md
- 1 link changed
```

At the end of the task, three files have changed:

```text
README.md
config.yaml
package.json
```

Even if the link is now correct, the changes to `config.yaml` and `package.json` were not part of the task. The unexpected changes should be reviewed and reverted if they are not required.

## How to check the scope

At the end of the task, compare the expected change with what actually changed:

```text
EXPECTED_FILES_CHANGED: 1
ACTUAL_FILES_CHANGED: 1

EXPECTED:
- README.md

ACTUAL:
- README.md

UNEXPECTED_CHANGES:
- none
```

File count alone is not enough. A protected section may have changed inside an expected file, so review the changed lines or diff when possible.

## Usable prompt

> **Make only the changes required to complete the assigned task. Do not modify unrelated files, text, configuration, or dependencies. Do not alter areas marked for preservation. If you notice an additional issue, report it instead of fixing it automatically. At the end, check which files and sections changed. If anything changed outside the task scope, identify it and do not leave it unreviewed.**

## Use in automation

In an automated workflow, expected files can be defined before the task starts. After the task, the system can compare that list with the files that actually changed.

If an unexpected file was modified, the change can be held for review instead of being accepted automatically. Stricter workflows can also compare changed lines with the areas that were allowed to change.

## When to use it

This method is especially useful for limited fixes to existing files or code, when working parts must be preserved, or when an agent should touch only specific files.

A detailed change-boundary record may not be necessary for small experiments that are easy to discard. For example, when comparing a few text formats in an empty test file, defining protected lines is usually unnecessary.
